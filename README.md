# Introduction
Machine learning techniques are employed to analyze a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending service to develop a model that can assess the creditworthiness of borrowers.

# Overview
The dataset, comprising 77,536 data points, was divided into training and testing sets. The training set was utilized to create an initial logistic regression model (Logistic Regression Model 1) using the LogisticRegression module from scikit-learn. This model was then applied to the testing dataset to assess whether a loan to borrowers in the testing set would be classified as low- or high-risk, with the results summarized below.

This initial model was based on a dataset containing 75,036 low-risk loan data points and 2,500 high-risk data points. To balance the training data and ensure the logistic regression model had an equal number of data points for both categories, the training set was resampled using the RandomOverSampler module from imbalanced-learn. This process generated 56,277 data points for both low-risk (0) and high-risk (1) loans based on the original dataset.

The resampled data was then used to construct a new logistic regression model (Logistic Regression Model 2). The goal of Logistic Regression Model 2 was to determine whether a loan to borrowers in the testing set would be classified as low- or high-risk. The results are summarized below.

# Findings
Logistic Regression Model 1:

- Precision: 93% (on average—100% precision in predicting low-risk loans, but only 87% precision for high-risk loans)
- Accuracy: 94%
- Recall: 95% (on average—100% recall for low-risk loans, while 89% recall for high-risk loans)

Logistic Regression Model 2:

- Precision: 93% (on average—100% precision in predicting low-risk loans, but only 87% precision for high-risk loans)
- Accuracy: 100%
- Recall: 100%

# Conclusion
Logistic Regression Model 2 is less prone to predicting false negatives. However, based on the confusion matrices for both models, Logistic Regression Model 2 produced slightly more false positives (classifying low-risk loans when they were actually high-risk).

If the objective of the model is to assess the likelihood of high-risk loans, neither model achieves more than 90% precision. Nonetheless, Logistic Regression Model 2 had fewer overall false predictions in the testing data and would be the preferred model due to its high accuracy and recall.
